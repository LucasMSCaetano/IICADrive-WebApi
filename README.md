## About this project

This is the first API version of the MAPA/IICA/BID project - Virtual Hubs.

In its initial version it has support for uploading files and organizing them!

## What's the point

Meet the demand of the project using our own virtual hub so that ***using this same project it is possible to have ease in using artificial intelligence to cross data.***
